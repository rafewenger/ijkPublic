IJK (Isosurface Jeneration Kode) 
is a set of C++ classes and routines for generating
isosurface patches in convex polyhedra in arbitrary dimensions.  It
constructs the isosurface patch as a subset of the convex hull of a
subset of polyhedra vertices and edge midpoints.  (See ``Isosurface
construction in any dimension using convex hulls'' by P. Bhaniramka,
R. Wenger, and R. Crawfis, IEEE Trans. on Vis. and Computer Graphics,
10 2004, pp. 130-141, and  "Isosurfacing in higher Dimensions" by
P. Bhaniramka, R. Wenger, and R. Crawfis, Visualization, 2000, Salt
Lake City Utah: IEEE Computer Society Press.)  

Program genisotable generates isosurface lookup tables for hypercubes
and simplices in arbitrary (small) dimensions.  Program diffisotable
outputs the difference of two isosurface tables.

Isotable, genisotable and diffisotable source code is available at
http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/graphics/isotable.

Source code includes K. Clarkson's program hull for generating convex hulls.
